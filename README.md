This software that i created is aimed to help people with simplifying complex conversions  and ease through time consuming calculations such as adding two sets of binary numbers at varying lengths. It is unique from others competitor projects due to its flexibility of range of choices. The software uses a modified version of tkinter which is a standard library in python, the only differendce is the new gui features. The software consists of two sections including a binary arithmetic and data conversion system that covers binary, hexadecimal, denary, and ASCII. The availability of multiple functions at the same scene makes this app quick and useful. You may have to download - "pip install customtkinter" before opening the execuatable file.
